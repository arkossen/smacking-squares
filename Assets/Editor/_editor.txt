// Editor folder
- In here you place custom editors for Unity3D.
- These can be meshes, textures, codes which are used for the custom editor itself.
- Editors can be Custom Editors, EditorWizard, seperate EditorWindow and more...
- Codes needs to be extends with Editor class which is from a seperate namespace. So include "using UnityEditor;" in your code.
